    "Motivation: A large part of playing FARA involves going through certain routines. These routines are fun to figure out, but their novelty wears off as the game progresses. When starting a new game of FARA, it is preferable to thoroughly search, harvest, and craft in the initial locality. It would be nice to automate away this early game routine. Another such routine is preparing for specific journeys which could involve harvesting and preparing shelter, meals, and rest."
